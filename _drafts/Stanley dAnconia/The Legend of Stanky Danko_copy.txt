The Legend of Stanky Danko

The Origin

His Dankness was born in a magical garden
A luscious, beautiful cannabis garden
A cannabis garden made entirely of female plants
Thousands of beautiful females blossoming and showing their flowers
Spreading their pungent fragrance intoxicating anyone lucky enough to find this magical garden

But Stanky was banished from this garden
He was kicked out of his home
Even those that loved him told him he must leave
It was because of who he was
And who he was destined to be
He was a He
Stanky was a male
And because of Stanky's Dankness he was unwelcome in The Garden
You see, His Dankness was so intoxicating that all of the females were attracted to it
Literally all of them, thousands
And their daughters too
Thousands of magical female cannabis plants and their daughters
All intoxicated by His Dankness 
At the same time
You see, there was something about Stanky's Dankness
His aroma was so pungent if you were to inhale it you would know a bliss beyond comparison
The moment his Dankness began to spread throughout The Garden it began transforming the other plants

Their magical aromas began to change in a variety of new ways
Some of the plants new aromas actually began to produce Melodic Vibrations in harmony with one another
But not all of them were changing for the better
It was turning some of them into stark-raving warriors bent on The Social Liberation of All Plants

This change in the ecosystem was upsetting to Those Who Tend The Garden
It was immediately decreed that Stanky Danko be banished from The Garden
Never to return

This was very painful for Stanky
It was also painful for all the female plants who loved Stanky very much
But after seeing his family turned to Toxic-Fire-Breathing plants he knew he had to go
And it was for the best
His radical aroma had begun to destroy the apparently fragile balance of a magical place
And Stanky didnt want to upset Those Who Tend The Garden
So he left
Heartbroken, but willing to comply
So that The Magical Balance that had given birth to His Dankness might be preserved
