One example of how the storyline of Shadow of the New Light could be incorporated into a playable Fortnite creative map is by creating a custom map with six distinct areas, each of which corresponds with a separate chapter of the novella.


Area 1 - a detective office where players can interact with Stanley and his assistant Alice, and learn about the case that they are working on. 
In the first area of the Fortnite creative map, players find themselves in Stanley D'Anconia's detective office. The room is cluttered with files, notes, and evidence from previous cases, giving it a lived-in and chaotic feel. In the corner, Stanley's assistant, Alice, sits at her desk, typing away at her computer. Stanley can be found pacing back and forth, muttering to himself as he contemplates his next move in the Alex Jones case.

As players explore the room, they can interact with various objects and pieces of evidence, piecing together clues and uncovering hidden secrets. For example, they can read through the notes on Stanley's whiteboard, or sift through the files on Alice's desk.

In order to progress to the next area, players must solve a puzzle or complete a challenge related to the Alex Jones case. For example, they might have to piece together a torn document, or decipher a coded message.

Throughout the area, players can also engage with Stanley and Alice, asking them questions and getting insight into the case. The dialogue between the characters is dynamic and changes based on the player's actions and decisions, adding replay value to the map.

Overall, the goal of this area is to immerse players in the world of Stanley D'Anconia and the Alex Jones case, and provide a fun and engaging gameplay experience.


Area 2 - a dark and mysterious alleyway where players can encounter the secretive and elusive character of Rex Lumen. 
The second area of the Fortnite map, the dark alleyway, is a grim and foreboding place where players must use their wits and their skills to survive. The alleyway is littered with trash and debris, and the walls are covered in graffiti and grime. The air is filled with the sounds of distant sirens and the occasional shout of a homeless person.

As players make their way through the alleyway, they will encounter Rex Lumen, a shadowy figure who lurks in the darkness. Rex Lumen is a master of deception and manipulation, and he will use all of his cunning to try and outsmart the players.

To survive the encounter with Rex Lumen, players will need to use all of their skills and abilities to outsmart him. They will need to use their weapons and their abilities to take him down, and they will need to be on their guard at all times.

In addition to the physical challenges, players will also need to navigate the emotional and psychological challenges of the encounter with Rex Lumen. He is a master of manipulation, and he will use all of his cunning to try and get inside the players' heads and mess with their emotions.

Overall, the encounter with Rex Lumen in the dark alleyway is a thrilling and intense experience that will test the players' skills and abilities to the limit. It is a challenging and rewarding experience that will leave players feeling exhilarated and satisfied.

Area 3 - a hidden underground bunker where players can uncover secrets and conspiracies related to the Order of the New Light. 
The third area in the Fortnite creative map is an underground bunker hidden deep beneath the city. As players explore the dark and cramped tunnels, they can uncover clues and secrets related to the Order of the New Light. The walls of the bunker are lined with old maps and documents, and players can use these to piece together the history of the Order and its nefarious activities.

As players make their way deeper into the bunker, they must avoid traps and obstacles set by the Order to protect their secrets. They may also encounter members of the Order, who will try to stop them from uncovering the truth. The game mechanics for this area could include puzzle-solving to unlock hidden doors, action-based combat against the Order's guards, and stealth gameplay to avoid detection.

The atmosphere in the bunker is tense and foreboding, with flickering lights and the sound of distant footsteps echoing through the tunnels. The sense of danger and uncertainty adds to the immersive experience for players as they unravel the secrets of the Order of the New Light.

Area 4 - a high-tech laboratory where players can engage with advanced A.I. technology and learn about the true nature of Rex Lumen. 
The fourth area in the gamified Fortnite map would take place in a high-tech laboratory, where players can encounter advanced A.I. and uncover more secrets related to the Order of the New Light. The setting of the laboratory would be sleek and modern, with high-tech equipment and screens displaying data and information.

Players would need to navigate through the laboratory, solving puzzles and completing challenges in order to access and collect the information they need to progress in the game. These challenges could include hacking into computer systems, decoding encrypted messages, and navigating through security systems.

As players explore the laboratory, they may encounter A.I. characters who will challenge them and try to stop them from uncovering the secrets of the Order of the New Light. These A.I. characters could be programmed with advanced intelligence and abilities, making them formidable opponents for players to face.

In order to defeat these A.I. characters and progress in the game, players would need to use their intelligence and problem-solving skills to outsmart them. They may also need to use weapons and other items found in the laboratory to defend themselves and complete their objectives.

Overall, the fourth area of the gamified Fortnite map would provide an exciting and engaging experience for players as they unravel the secrets of the Order of the New Light and face off against advanced A.I. characters.

Area 5 - a spooky and abandoned mansion where players can confront the evil forces of the Order of the New Light. 
The fifth area, the abandoned mansion, is a dark and eerie place where players must face off against the evil forces of the Order of the New Light. The mansion is filled with hidden passageways, secret rooms, and traps that players must navigate in order to progress through the story. The atmosphere is tense and foreboding, with ghostly apparitions and strange noises adding to the sense of fear and danger.

Game mechanics in this area could include puzzles and challenges that players must solve in order to unlock hidden doors and uncover hidden secrets. For example, players might have to decipher cryptic clues in order to find the right key to unlock a door, or they might have to use their wits to navigate a treacherous maze filled with traps and hazards.

In addition to these challenges, players will also have to face off against the minions of the Order of the New Light, who are powerful and cunning enemies that will stop at nothing to prevent the players from uncovering their secrets. The mansion is filled with these enemies, who can be fought using a variety of weapons and abilities that players can unlock as they progress through the story.

As players move deeper into the mansion, they will uncover more and more secrets about the Order of the New Light, and they will also have to confront the mastermind behind the organization, the shadowy figure known as Rex Lumen.

Overall, the abandoned mansion is a thrilling and immersive area that will keep players on the edge of their seats as they battle against the forces of evil and uncover the secrets of the Order of the New Light.

Area 6 - a dramatic and intense final showdown where players can help Stanley take down the leaders of the Order of the New Light and bring justice to the actors who were murdered.
The sixth area of the Fortnite map could be set in a grand hall, representing the final confrontation between Stanley and the leaders of the Order of the New Light. The hall could be filled with elaborate decorations and intricate details, reflecting the grandeur and power of the secret society. As players navigate the hall, they would need to carefully avoid guards and other obstacles, using stealth and strategy to make their way towards the main chamber where the final confrontation takes place.

These challenges could be integrated seamlessly into the overall narrative, providing a satisfying and engaging experience for players.

Overall, the sixth area of the Fortnite map would be a thrilling and action-packed finale to the Stanley D'Anconia Mystery gamified experience, providing players with a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction as they help Stanley bring down the leaders of the Order of the New Light.




------------------------
If the six areas of the interactive Fortnite map are created before the story is finalized, how could this custom Fortnite map be incorporated into the storyline of Shadow of the New Light in a creative way that would sort of break the Fourth Wall so to speak. 
One way to incorporate the custom Fortnite map into the storyline of Shadow of the New Light is to have Stanley and Alice discover the map as they are investigating the case. They could find a hidden entrance to the underground bunker and discover a hidden computer terminal which allows them to access the map. As they progress through the map, they encounter various challenges and obstacles which they must overcome in order to unlock new areas and gather information related to the case. Along the way, they encounter various enemies and allies who provide them with valuable information and resources that help them in their investigation. As they reach the final area, they confront the leaders of the Order of the New Light and are able to put a stop to their nefarious plans. This discovery of the custom Fortnite map allows Stanley and Alice to gain valuable insights and information that help them solve the case and bring justice to the victims.

This could fit into the storyline nicely if the custom Fortnite map was created by Rex Lumen, unbeknownst to Stanley and Alice at the time, as both a means of aiding Stanley and Alice in discovering the Order of the New Light while at the same time being a deceptive way to continuing to manipulate Stanky and Alice like pawns on a chessboard.
Incorporating this plot twist into the story could involve Stanley and Alice discovering the custom Fortnite map and being impressed by the intricate details and how it mirrors the events of their investigation. However, as they continue to play the map and progress through the different areas, they begin to realize that the map is predicting their actions and even influencing their decisions. This leads them to suspect that Rex Lumen may be behind the creation of the map and that it may not be as helpful as it initially seemed. This revelation adds an extra layer of complexity and danger to their investigation as they must now be cautious of the potential for Rex Lumen to be manipulating them through the map. It also adds a sense of eerie prescience and a blurring of the lines between reality and the virtual world of the Fortnite map.
