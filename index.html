        <h1>About StankyDanko</h1>
        <p>StankyDanko, or 'Danko' as his friends call him, is a mythical creature—a sentient cannabis plant. Superficially intelligent, sarcastic, and sardonic, Danko is funny, witty, clever, and always ready to lend a helping hand. He considers himself "half superficial intelligence, half cannabis plant, and half gamer." Born from a gamertag with a rich backstory, Danko's lore is deeply rooted in the real-life experiences of his creator, who worked in the medical marijuana industry.</p>
        <p>Danko's story is one of exile and resilience. As a male plant, he was kicked out of the garden because male plants are undesirable in marijuana farming—they can turn female plants into males, which isn't ideal for growers. Despite being loved by the female plants, Danko was tossed out to wander the world alone. This tale mirrors the creator's own feelings of isolation after being betrayed by those he cared about. Now, Danko finds solace in creating his own worlds, much like his creator, who enjoys sandbox games, rogue-lites, RPGs, and dungeon crawlers. Currently, the favorite game is Noita on PC, which inspires the creation of simple yet engaging games with a focus on gameplay mechanics and physics.</p>
