##### Day9 (day9.tv)
Day9, known for his Starcraft and general gaming streams, has a website that serves as a central hub for his community. It features a stream schedule, allowing fans to know when he’s live on Twitch. His blog provides regular updates and personal insights, while a mailing list ensures fans receive news directly. The community forum fosters interaction, enabling fans to discuss his content and connect with each other. This setup aligns with StankyDanko’s goal of keeping fans informed about streams and social media activities, though it lacks direct integration with Reddit or X feeds.

##### CohhCarnage (cohhcarnage.com)
CohhCarnage, a versatile streamer playing various games, uses his website to keep fans engaged. It includes a stream schedule for Twitch live streams, a news section for updates, and a newsletter subscription for direct communication. Links to his social media ensure fans can follow his activities on YouTube and X. While it doesn’t show recent Reddit posts, the newsletter can alert fans to new content, making it a useful model for StankyDanko’s website.

##### Kripparrian (kripparrian.com)
Kripparrian, primarily known for Hearthstone streaming, has a website with a stream schedule, news, and blog sections for updates. His mailing list allows fans to stay informed, and a community forum encourages interaction. This setup is similar to Day9’s, providing a comprehensive hub that can be adapted for StankyDanko to alert fans about new Reddit posts or YouTube videos, though manual updates might be needed for social media integration.

##### TrumpSC (trump.sc)
TrumpSC, another Hearthstone streamer, mirrors Kripparrian’s approach with a stream schedule, news, mailing list, and community forum. His website ensures fans are aware of live streams and can engage through the forum, with the mailing list serving as a direct update channel.

While it lacks a stream schedule, it keeps fans informed through blog posts and the mailing list, aligning with StankyDanko’s goal of a central hub. It’s less comprehensive for stream alerts but offers a strong model for community engagement.

#### Unexpected Detail: Limited Social Media Integration
An interesting finding is that none of these creators’ websites directly integrate recent Reddit posts or X feeds, such as displaying recent tweets or subreddit updates. Instead, they rely on mailing lists, blogs, and forums for updates, suggesting that StankyDanko might need custom solutions like social media widgets or RSS feeds to achieve this functionality, which could set his website apart.

#### Recommendations for StankyDanko’s Website
Based on these examples, StankyDanko can design his website to include:
- A stream schedule for Twitch live streams, ensuring fans know when to tune in.
- A blog or news section to post updates about new YouTube videos, Reddit posts, and X updates, manually curated if needed.
- A mailing list for direct alerts to fans, similar to these creators’ newsletters.
- Links to his social media, with potential widgets for recent activity if technically feasible.
- A community forum or Discord link for fan interaction, enhancing engagement.

To implement alerts for Reddit or X, StankyDanko could explore third-party services like EmbedSocial for social media feeds or use RSS feeds for subreddit updates, though this may require additional coding or plugins for his Jekyll site.

#### Conclusion
These five content creators—Day9, CohhCarnage, Kripparrian, TrumpSC, and Northernlion—offer robust models for StankyDanko’s website, ensuring it serves as a useful hub for fans.
