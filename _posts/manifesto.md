# StankyDanko Manifesto

**Our guiding principles drive everything we do.**

### Empowering
We believe that creativity and knowledge should be accessible to everyone. That’s why we freely share our tools, resources, and experiences with the community.

### Enduring
We believe that great experiences should last. That’s why we create games with timeless mechanics and build websites using open, future-proof technologies.

### Private
We believe that your privacy is paramount. That’s why our games and websites are designed to protect your data, with no unnecessary collection or sharing.

### Adaptable
We believe that tools should adapt to you, not the other way around. That’s why our games and websites are highly customizable and extensible.

### Independent
We believe in creative integrity. That’s why we are 100% community-supported, ensuring our work remains true to our vision.

### Mindful
We believe in mastering digital tools to enhance our lives, not control them. That’s why we prioritize practices and platforms that promote balance, purpose, and personal growth, striving for Digital Life Mastery.
